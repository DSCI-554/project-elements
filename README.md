## Project Summary

<!-- 🎒 Add a project summary here in 250 words or less. -->
Our final project is on air travel as it is widely used by people around the country, especially us college students. We created a dashboard to present data about flight delays, primarily domestic. The dashboard allows users to understand the reasons why flights are delayed, which airports around the country deal with the most delays, which travel dates see the most delays, and which airlines have the most delays. To best represent the information, we decided to create an interactive line graph to show carrier delays, a donut chart to show the reasons why flights are delayed, two USA maps (d3 and mapbox) to show the delayed flight routes, and a tree map to show location by state of most delays.
