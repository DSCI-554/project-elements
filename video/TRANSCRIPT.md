The legend indicates the causes of delay in different colors. By clicking on a state, paths of all delayed flights in colors would be shown. The detailed delay information will pop up once the mouse move over the path. For keeping the map clear, users must click the shown state again to close it before checking another state.
The second map is Mapbox. This page has similar instruction and explanation as the previous one. This map asks for aiport code as the other input. Once both inputs are selected, the flight paths will be shown. Then clicking on one path, the detailed information will be shown in info box.
